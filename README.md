# Brain Tumor Segmentation

## Content
This repository centers around the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 (BraTS2020). 
Glioblastomas are frequent brain tumors and show very aggressive characteristics. The 5-year survival rate is limited to 5-7 %.
..

## Data
The data was taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/brain-tumor-segmentation-in-mri-brats-2015/data). 
As the folders in this link combine three subsequent years of the same images, this project aimed to model the data of 2020.

## Set up the Environment
### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 



- For installing the virtual environment and the required package you can either follow the commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Or ....
-  use the [Makefile](Makefile) and run `make setup` or install it manually with the following commands:

     ```BASH
    make setup
    ```
    After that active your environment by following commands:
    ```BASH
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:
    ```Bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```


   
## Usage

In order to train the model and store test data in the data folder and the model in models run:

**`Note`**: Make sure your environment is activated.

```bash
python example_files/train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python example_files/predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```

## Limitations

Development libraries are part of the production environment, normally these would be separate as the production code should be as slim as possible.
